This repository contains a compressed set of logs representing a
week's worth of ping times on Amazon AWS between:

* `us-east-1`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `sa-east-1`, `ap-northeast-1`, `ap-southeast-1`
* `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`, `us-east-1d`
* Three hosts in `us-east-1b`

All servers were `m1.small` instances.
